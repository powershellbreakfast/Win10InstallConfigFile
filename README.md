# Win10InstallConfigFile
Here is how you get windows to prompt you to install any version of windows 10 you like.
This is very useful when upgrading from home to pro to do a clean install.

1)Install windows onto a flashdrive with the media creation tool or Rufus and an ISO

2)Locate the **Sources** folder on the flashdrive with install media.

3)Put **ei.cfg** inside the **Sources** folder.

Great Success!

Now windows 10 installer will ask what version to install instead of assuming you want a specific version.
